This week I learned some more of the inner workings of OpenGL, specifically with regards to using the perspective matrix and how to 
alter it to achieve a zoom effect. I also was able to observe firsthand some of the difficulties of tracking position and rotation
in 3D space with only one point of reference.

During my tutorial presentation I attempted to display Pitch/Yaw, however the effect they produced was quite similar to simply 
translating up down left or right at the rate of movement I was using. I wound up thinking I had done something wrong and went back
over my work, only to realize that I just needed a second point of reference to better illustrate the behaviour.



Gonna have area2D based richtextlabels which scroll out info.
Can hardcode text, have them hide when ready()
then reveal the rest over a couple seconds.
	Maybe have a check, if ., pause for .125 seconds?
Can have them just fire off, also declare whether one shot or re-usable.
